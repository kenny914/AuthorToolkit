#🧠 C++ Author App Development Plan

## 🧩 1. Choose a GUI Framework

Select a framework that supports desktop GUIs and integrates well with C++:

* **Qt** → Best all-around choice (timers, text widgets, layouts, database tools).
* **wxWidgets** → Lightweight and native across platforms.
* **Dear ImGui** → Simple and fast, good for minimal interfaces.
* **GTKmm** → Great for Linux-focused applications.

> 💡 *Recommendation:* Use **Qt** for its balance of power, documentation, and cross-platform support.

## ⏱ 2. Timer / Stopwatch

**Purpose:** Track writing sessions, breaks, or sprints.

**Core Components:**

* Background timer object or thread to track elapsed time.
* Buttons: **Start**, **Pause**, **Reset**, and optionally **Lap**.
* Real-time UI updates every second.

**Design Tips:**

* Keep timer logic independent from GUI elements.
* Store elapsed time in memory and save session duration to file or database.

---

## 📝 3. Word Count Tracker

**Purpose:** Count and visualize writing productivity.

**Features:**

* Real-time word count as user types.
* Session word count (resets daily or manually).
* Daily/weekly/monthly word history.
* Word goal progress bar or chart.

**Implementation Ideas:**

* Use a **text editor widget** for input.
* Parse text to count words, sentences, or characters.
* Store counts in a **JSON file** or **SQLite database**.
* Optional: display analytics graphs.

---

## ✏️ 4. Author Tools

**Purpose:** Support creative organization and reference management.

**Suggested Panels / Tabs:**

* **Outline View** – tree or hierarchical structure of chapters/sections.
* **Notes Panel** – simple text area for quick ideas.
* **Character / World Info** – optional forms or tables for details.
* **Research / Reference Links** – optional list with external resources.

**UI Layout Ideas:**

* Split-view: main writing area on right, tools on left or bottom.
* Tabs or collapsible panels for easy switching between tools.

---

## 💾 5. Data Management

**Purpose:** Save and load all user data safely and reliably.

**Storage Choices:**

* Writing files → Plain text or Markdown (`.md`).
* Metadata (notes, outlines, word counts) → JSON or SQLite.
* Settings → Small config file (`.ini`, `.json`, or platform-specific).

**Features to Add:**

* Autosave on timer or keystroke interval.
* Manual Save / Save As buttons.
* File recovery or backup system.

---

## ⚙️ 6. Optional Advanced Features

Enhance the user experience with extras:

* **Themes:** Dark/light or custom color schemes via Qt stylesheets.
* **Writing Goals:** Daily or total progress tracking with visual feedback.
* **Exports:** Convert to Markdown, PDF, or DOCX.
* **Focus Mode:** Fullscreen, distraction-free layout.
* **Spell Check:** Integrate **Hunspell** or a similar library.

## 🧠 7. Architecture Overview

**Organize your codebase into clear layers:**

| Layer                 | Purpose                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Core Logic**        | Timers, word counters, data handling    |
| **UI Layer**          | Windows, widgets, and layout management |
| **Controllers**       | Connect user actions to logic           |
| **Persistence Layer** | File I/O, saving/loading user data      |

**Structure Example:**

```
/src
 ├─ core/
 │   ├─ timer.cpp
 │   ├─ wordcounter.cpp
 │   └─ storage.cpp
 ├─ ui/
 │   ├─ mainwindow.cpp
 │   ├─ panels/
 │   │   ├─ outlinepanel.cpp
 │   │   └─ notespanel.cpp
 ├─ controllers/
 │   └─ appcontroller.cpp
 ├─ resources/
 │   ├─ icons/
 │   └─ styles/
 └─ main.cpp
```

## 🧩 Summary

This project combines **utility (timers, word tracking)** with **creative workflow tools (notes, outlines)**.
By structuring it with modular components and a reliable GUI toolkit like **Qt**, you’ll have a foundation for a professional authoring tool that can grow over time.
